            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is well known that the <hi>Poor</hi> in this Nation, have a Greater Revenue than any Incorporate Body or Society of Men in the Whole Kingdom have; and yet they are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maintain'd or Relieved by it, That they daily Increaſe in their Numbers; the Cauſe of which, ſome impute to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſome to the Non-execution of the Laws already in Force, others to the Miſapplying and Miſmanagement of the Money yearly Raiſed; For any or all which Grievances, This here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, will be a certain Remedy (if His Majeſty and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Great Wiſdom, do think fit to digeſt it into a Law) ſo as it may not be Stifled, but throughly Executed, for the Good of the Whole Nation; For it is well known that in Foreign Countries, no people are ſuffered to Live idle and to Beg, as they are in <hi>England;</hi> altho' the <hi>Engliſh Nation</hi> hath more of its own Growth and Product, and might Employ them to more Profit and Advantage than any Kingdom or Country in <hi>Europe</hi> can Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their Poor; And therefore it is hoped, That His Majeſty and the Parliament, when they do ſeriouſly Conſider the ſame, will provide ſuch Remedies, that all the idle People in the Nation may be Employed, ſo as that they may Earn their own Living by their Work, without the Poor's Rates, or Begging, or Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To ſet forth a way for the doing of which, is the Intent of the Author in publiſhing this <hi>Little Book;</hi> which, if put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice will effectually do it; ſo as that in few Years there will be no Beggars, or ſcarcely a Thief in <hi>England;</hi> for their being bred in Idleneſs whilſt young, is the Cauſe of there being ſo many both Thieves and Beggars: But by this here Propoſed, all Children will be Bred up to Work from their Infancy, ſo as they will know how to get their own Living, without Begging or Stealing; and beſides there will be always Work ready for them, or for any that want Work, or will come to work; ſo that none can excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Saying they cannot get Work, or elſe they would not do as they do; which is now the common Excuſe of moſt Beggars,<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#UOM" extent="1 line">

            <p>THESE few following Lines are Publiſhed by the Author, to ſhew to the Commonalty of <hi>England,</hi> That there is a way to make the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Rich, notwithſtanding the War, and all the preſent Wants and Preſſures it now groans under for want of Money (by which Trade is Decayed) and alſo by reaſon of the heavy <hi>Taxes</hi> which do now lie upon it; all which, by the Ways herein mentioned, will be taken off and amended, and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> and <hi>Navy</hi> will be better Paid than at any time yet they have been, altho' the <hi>War</hi> do continue for ſeveral Years longer; and all this may be done without any <hi>Tax</hi> upon the People, but only the Rates that are now paid to the <hi>Poor;</hi> and which will continue ever to be paid, except the Nation by this Means be Eaſed of them; which if the Ways hereafter ſet down, be put in Practiſe, it will in a few Years be; and alſo the <hi>Nation</hi> will Gain by it near Double to what the Charge of the <hi>War</hi> is, as will appear by this <hi>Little Book.</hi> And the <hi>Author</hi> doth not doubt but that he is able to give Rational and Satisfactory Anſwers to all the Objections that can be made againſt any thing herein Propoſed, if the Objectors pleaſe to own their Objections, either in <hi>Print,</hi> or cauſe them to be ſent to <hi>Him</hi> in Writing, with their Names to them; And the <hi>Author</hi> hopes the <hi>Readers</hi> will not ſo much Cenſure him for want of Method, rudeneſs of Phraſe, or blunt Expreſſions in this <hi>Book,</hi> as they will be ready to excuſe Him for endeavouring to ſhew his Love and Duty to the Publick good of the Kingdom, by adding his Mite to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury: And that all that truly wiſh the Proſperity of the <hi>Nation</hi> will put their helping Hand to ſo good a Work, by Rectifying (rather than Condemning) what is herein amiſs, and by adding to it what is wanting.</p>

And there hath been a time in <hi>England</hi> (as may be ſeen in <hi>Chronicles,</hi> when there was none but <hi>Leather Money</hi> in the Nation, and that Serv'd all People's Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion (it paſſing Current) as well as Silver or Gold doth now; And we know in our own Memory, That there were <hi>Braſs Bodles</hi> ſet forth by Tradeſmen, all over <hi>England,</hi> and paſſed for Half-penny apiece, which did the ſame Service in Paying any ſmall Summ, as either Gold or Silver would do, till ſuch time as the Government thought good to Prohibit them from paſſing any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: And there will be no danger of any Man's Looſing by theſe <hi>Bills;</hi> for there will be a Sufficient, and the beſt <hi>Fund</hi> that is in the World ſettled, to pay them all off in a certain Time, as hereafter will appear; And theſe <hi>Bills</hi> will be of the ſame Uſe (till Paid, Cancell'd and Deſtroyed, as hereafter mentioned) and as Good to all Men as any Money; For if a Man take a piece of Parchment or Paper, Tinn, Copper, Lead or Leather, for a Debt owing, or for Goods, or Eſtate ſold, or for Rent to the value of Five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings (or for a greater or leſs Summ) and that piece of Parchment or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Tinn, Copper, Lead or Leather, will paſs from him to pay a Debt, or purchaſe any Thing that he wants of that Value he took it for, then no Man can deny but that ſuch a piece of Parchment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is as good for his Uſe, as ſo much Coin'd Silver; And if the Propoſed <hi>Bills</hi> be made to paſs Current by a Law, they will do it; For it is nothing that makes Money paſs now at a certain Rate as it doth, but a Law, Silver and Gold being a Commodity that riſes and falls, like other Goods; which we have lately had Experience of in Guineas (to ſome Men's Loſs) That it is only a Law that can Regulate Money to paſs as it doth, and conſequently a Law will make the <hi>Bills</hi> here propoſed to do the like.</p>
            <p>And if His Majeſty and the Parliament ſhall think good to paſs this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal into a Law, then every Pariſh in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> may have ſo many of theſe <hi>Bills</hi> Appropriated to it, as ſuch Pariſh Rates to the <hi>Poor</hi> amounts to in Sixteen Years: which Summs may be laid out in Building one Houſe in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101206:4"/>every Pariſh, where all the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Labouring People</hi> that want Work (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men, Women or Children, may at any time Reſort and be Employed in ſuch Work as each of them is moſt Capable of, and at ſuch Rates as is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given in that Country or Place; So that none will need to be Idle or to Beg by reaſon they can get no Work, as now is the common Complaint of moſt Beggars, which generally ſay, <hi>If they could but get any Work, they would not Beg:</hi> And in each of the ſaid Houſes there may be Conveniences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Old, or Indigent Poor, or Children may be Lodged and Provided with all Neceſſaries; and alſo may be Employed in doing ſomething, according to their ſeveral Abilities, there being few or none (above five Years old) but what are able to Earn ſomething by their Work towards their own Living; And all Children that are put into theſe Houſes to be Maintain'd, may be kept there till they be Fifteen or Sixteen Years of Age, and be employed, ſo that they may Learn to Work well, and in that Time they may alſo be Taught to Read, Write, and Caſt Accompts, and be Virtuouſly Educated, ſo as they will be Serviceable to the Kingdom in their Generation; whereas now they are only bred up in Vice, or at beſt in Idleneſs and Begging, which makes them grow ſo many as they are, and will certainly in time, be the Ruin of the whole Kingdom, if they be not better Employed and ſet to Work, whilſt Young, to prevent it.</p>
            <p>And in every of the ſaid Houſes, there may be laid in a Stock of <hi>Wooll, Hemp, Flax, Iron,</hi> or any other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactury, according to the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> or the Employment that is uſed moſt in that Country or Place; ſufficient to Employ all in that Pariſh that want Work, or any that will come to Work; And after ſuch Houſes ſhall be Built, and ſuch Stock laid into them; as the Building and Stock will amount to ſixteen Years Value of all the <hi>Poor's Rates</hi> (which if in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> they amount to 900 hundred thouſand Pounds a Year and no more) it will be 14 Millions, and 400 thouſand pounds; and then there will remain of the 20 Millions of <hi>Bills</hi> propoſed for the Uſe of the <hi>Poor,</hi> Five Millions, and Six hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds; which Summ of five Millions, and Six hundred thouſand pounds, if it be laid out in Land at 20 years Value, will purchaſe 280 Thouſand pounds a Year; but if the <hi>Poor's Rates</hi> amount to more than 900 Hundred thouſand pounds a Year, then there will more go in Building and Stock, and there will be leſs to purchaſe Land; and then theſe <hi>Bills</hi> will be ſooner paid, Cancell'd, and Deſtroyed, as hereafter will appear.</p>
            <p>Now it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, that one eight part of what is to be Employed in Building and Laying in Stock for Trade, will be fully ſufficient to Build all the Houſes (there being no need to build a Houſe in every little Pariſh; but that a ſmall Pariſh, where there is but a very few <hi>Poor,</hi> may in this be joyned to the next Pariſh to it, to ſave the building of a Houſe; So that if there go an eight part of the Whole in Building, then there will be Twelve Millions and Six hundred thouſand pounds, to be employed in Stock for a Trade, except ſome ſmall part to pay Wages with, until ſuch time as part of the Goods laid in are Wrought-up, and fit to be Sold to Raiſe Money to pay Wages, and the Charges of the Undertaking, and to Maintain the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent Poor, and Children, and to purchaſe other Goods to keep up the Stock:</p>
            <p>Now the Trade of theſe <hi>Work-Houſes</hi> or <hi>Colledges,</hi> may in ſome Countries be in Working-up to the height and increaſing our Woollen Manufactury, which is now Tranſported before it is near Wrought to perfection, which is to the Great Loſs of the Nation, as may eaſily be made to appear; and in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101206:5"/>ſome places it may be in the Linnen Manufactury, in Making Linnen-Cloth, ſuch as is Neceſſary for the Uſe and Wear of the Nation; and in Making Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis for Sail-Cloth; and in Making all Sorts of Cordage, Line, and Twine for Ships; and in Making Yarn and Threed for Nets; and in Making Nets for the Fiſhery: And this will in a great Meaſure encourage the Growth of Hemp and Flax in this Kingdom, the Neglect or Want of which, is a Great damage to the Nation, by reaſon of the Conſumption of our Money to Fetch it in; altho' at the ſame time we might have it as Good and Cheaper, of our own Growth, if Induſtry were Countenanced and Encouraged amongſt us, and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Vice decryed; And the Trade in ſome places may be in Iron-Work, in Making Nails and Boults for Ships, both for His Majeſty's Yards, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's Ships; and in Making all Sorts of Edge-Tools and Nails, and all other Iron Commodities, both for Uſe here, and for Tranſportation: Any, or all which Trades will be vaſtly beneficial to the Nation, if they be Encouraged and order'd by a Law, ſo as to be Manag'd to the beſt Advantage for the <hi>Publick Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Benefit</hi> that will accrue to the <hi>Nation,</hi> only out of the <hi>Profits</hi> of this <hi>Trade</hi> or <hi>Trades,</hi> will be more than Two Millions a Year, as may be thus Demonſtrated: All <hi>Tradeſmen</hi> know well, and it is <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> ſo that all People may know it, if they will take Notice, <hi>That a Tradeſman of any Trade, that hath</hi> 500 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
               <hi>Stock to Begin with, can, and doth out of the Profits of a Trade, driven by that Stock (if he underſtand his Trade, and be careful and diligent in it) Maintain his Family better, wear better Cloaths, ſpend Higher, and have more Money always at Command, than a Gentleman of</hi> 100 <hi>Pounds a Year Eſtate in Land; and beſides, can commonly give his Children better Fortune than a Gentleman of ſuch an Eſtate; and therefore, ſuch Tradeſmen muſt needs get much more than a Hundred pounds a Year by ſuch a Stock, or elſe it were impoſſible for him to do it:</hi> And if the Stock in Trade in theſe Houſes do Gain the like in Proportion; and in all Probability it will Gain much more, it being a maxim in Trade, that great Stocks gain far more in proportion than ſmall ones do; then if there be but Twelve Millions in Stock for Trade, the Gain by the Trade will be Two Millions and Four hundred thouſand pounds a Year; which, added to what is hereafter ſet forth, will be Eight or Ten Millions a Year, clear Profit to the Nation.</p>
            <p>And that there may be a certain <hi>Fund</hi> and <hi>Security,</hi> That the <hi>Bills</hi> ſo iſſued ſhall be paid in a ſhort time, ſo as none can doubt there can be any Loſs by them; The <hi>Poor's Rates,</hi> and the <hi>Rents</hi> of <hi>Land</hi> here propoſed to be bought, and all <hi>Profits</hi> ariſing by the Trade (after the <hi>Old,</hi> and <hi>Indigent Poor</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> that are not able to Earn their whole Living by their Work, are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, and the Charges of the Undertaking paid) may be ſettled to be paid yearly into the hands of the Commiſſioners aforementioned (in <hi>Bills</hi> or <hi>Mony</hi>) and the Commiſſioners may be obliged to pay off, Cancel, and deſtroy ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſaid <hi>Bills</hi> yearly, as ſuch Sums ſo paid to them either in <hi>Bills</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> will amount to.</p>
            <p>By which Payments all the <hi>Bills</hi> for the whole Summ of thirty Millions will be paid off, Cancell'd and deſtroyed, in leſs than ten Years, as may be thus demonſtrated; The profits of the Trade, as before ſhewed, will amount to Two Millions and Four hundred thouſand pounds a Year, the Rents of Land propoſed to be bought, will amount to Two hundred and eighty thouſand pounds a Year, the <hi>Poor's Rates</hi> are Nine hundred thouſand pounds a Year: All which Sums, added together, make three Millions and five hundred and eighty thouſand pounds a Year; and it is reaſonably to think that 200
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101206:5"/>thouſand pounds a Year of that Summ, will Maintain the <hi>Poor</hi> what they will want more than they can Earn by their Work, and pay the Charges of the Undertaking; but if Three hundred and eighty thouſand pounds a Year, be allowed to do this with, there will then remain Three Millions and two hundred thouſand pounds a Year, which will pay all the <hi>Bills</hi> in nine Years and half; And it may be thus made to appear, That there will not need ſo much as 380 thouſand pounds a Year, as afore-allowed to pay the Charges of the Undertaking, and to maintain the <hi>Old, and Indigent Poor, and Children;</hi> for there is no <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>Lame</hi> people ſo weak, nor no Children of five years Old or upward, but may be Employed and Taught to Earn very near enough to Maintain them with, by Sorting, Locking, and Picking of <hi>Wooll,</hi> or by Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Linnen</hi> or <hi>Wollen;</hi> or by Winding, Doubling or Twiſting <hi>Yarn,</hi> or by Knitting of <hi>Nets</hi> or <hi>Stockins,</hi> or by ſome other ſuch kind of eaſie Work; in which the <hi>Blind</hi> may alſo be employed, and thoſe that are ſtrong, tho' they are <hi>Blind,</hi> may be employed in other Works.</p>
            <p>Now to ſet forth and make appear ſome part of the vaſt Benefits that will accrue to the Nation by putting this in Practice; they are as followeth, and is thus made Plain; There are in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> more than Ten thouſand Pariſhes, now ſuppoſing that theſe Pariſhes one with another, have but fifty a piece of Men, Women and Children, that now are Unemployed, and live by Almes, Begging and Stealing (and I believe all people will Conclude, that the Poor get five times more by Begging and Stealing, than the Pariſh Rates come to) which fifty in a Pariſh, one Pariſh with another, are much fewer than they can be thought to be; it being certainly known, that in Pariſhes in ſome Cities and great Towns, there is more than Five hundred in a Pariſh; but at fifty in a Pariſh, one with another, they will amount to Five hundred thouſand people, and if they one with another, Live now of Sixpence aday, which they now get out of the Pariſh Rates for the Poor, and by Begging and Stealing, the whole will amount to above four Millions and half a year: All which will be ſaved to the Nation by Employing them, and they when they are Employed and ſet to Work, will not earn ſo little as Sixpence apiece a day, which will amount to four Millions and a half more a year. So that there is Nine Millions a year ſaved and got to the Nation by Employing them, and two Millions a year as afore-ſhewed by the Profits of the Trade; all which amounts to Eleven Millions a year; Beſides what the Nation will Gain by having our Commodities, for all or moſt uſes made amongſt our ſelves, and by Working our own Manufactury to perfection, which will much Encourage the Merchants to bring dying Stuff, and other Things neceſſary to do it with; And if the Wollen Manufactury be wrought to perfection before it be ſent out, it will bring in double the Profit to the Nation, it now doth; And ſuch a Trade will Employ and ſet to Work all other Trades, by Reaſon it will make <hi>Mony</hi> Circulate plentifully, which is the Life and Vigour of all Trade: Beſides, after the <hi>Bills</hi> are paid, the <hi>Poor's Rates</hi> will for ever Ceaſe to be paid any more, ſo that the Nation clearly Gains them, and there will be the Work-Houſes and the Stock in them, with all the Profits that ariſe by the Trade, and the Rents of Land bought all Remaining, which will be ſo great a Revenue as will mightily enrich the Nation, and enable it to do very Great Things for the Good of the <hi>Publick</hi> in a few Years; and many other Commodities will ariſe to the Nation by it, too long here to inſert; But theſe already mentioned, the <hi>Author</hi> hopes are Sufficient to induce all thoſe that deſire the proſperity of the Kingdom, to ſet to their helping-hands to ſo good a Work; For by this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101206:6"/>means there will be <hi>Mony</hi> Speedily diſperſt into every Pariſh in <hi>England,</hi> and there it will be preſently Laid out in Building and Stock, to ſet the Trade a going; So that the whole Nation will be plentifully Supplied with <hi>Mony</hi> in a ſhort time, the want of which is now ſo great a burden, that it makes the Nation to groan under the weight of it; and it cannot ſo well and ſo ſoon be Remedied by any other Way or Means whatſoever, as it will be by this.</p>
            <p>But here ſome objections that I have already met with againſt this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, requires an anſwer; The which objections, I will here aſſert in their full force, and as near as I can, in the ſame Words I Received them, which the Gentleman that made them will know that I do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is objected that although theſe <hi>Bills</hi> do paſs for Current <hi>Mony</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo may pay the <hi>Navy</hi> and the <hi>Souldiers</hi> that are in <hi>England,</hi> and may Provide all Stores and Neceſſaries both for the <hi>Navy</hi> and the <hi>Army,</hi> that the Nation affords; yet they will not pay the Kings <hi>Army</hi> that are beyond the Seas.</p>

               <hi>Obj.</hi> Theſe <hi>Bills</hi> will hinder the Merchants from bringing in Foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, becauſe they cannot carry Them beyond Seas to pay for others.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If Merchants bring Foreign Commodities to us, with an intent to Carry away our Mony in <hi>Specie</hi> for them, then the Nation had much better be without them than have them; And if it be not to carry away the Mony, but to Lay it out here in Goods; then theſe <hi>Bills</hi> will be as good as Mony, they paſſing in all Payments, and purchaſing all ſorts of Goods as well; And this will cauſe more of the Product and Manufactury of the Nation to be Tranſported: For now the Merchant can carry away Money to Advantage; but then there will be a Force upon them to lay out all the <hi>Bills</hi> here, becauſe they will go in no other Country, which will much Advance our own Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factury and Trade, altho' the Merchant may be diſpleaſed at it.</p>

If the Parliament ſhould attempt to raiſe ſo Great a Sum as Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Thirty Millions, and the Thing ſhould miſcarry, it would be a Loſs paſt Remedy; therefore beſt to begin with ſome ſmall Summ upon ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fund, for His Majeſty's Uſe, and try what that will do before they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſo much.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101206:6"/>they muſt elſe do, if the War continue; and the other twenty Millions will be wholly in their own hands, being diſperſt into every Pariſh in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> where the Fund alſo will be to pay the <hi>Bills</hi> with; ſo that none can fear to loſe by the <hi>Bills,</hi> for they may pay them themſelves, by every Pariſh paying ſo many <hi>Bills</hi> into the <hi>Office</hi> Yearly, as the the <hi>Poor's Rates</hi> of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and the Profits in Trade do amount to until there be none left, and by that means only all the the <hi>Bills</hi> will return to the <hi>Office,</hi> and be Cancell'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in nine or ten years: And if the King and Patliament pleaſe to let the <hi>Bank</hi> already ſettled be paid off by this, then the Nation will ſave all the Money that now pays the Intereſt of that <hi>Bank;</hi> and that Intereſt ſo ſaved, will pay off all the <hi>Bills</hi> that pay that <hi>Bank,</hi> in 12 or 14 Years at moſt; but if it do go on as it is now Settled, it will be as far from being paid at the end of that time, as it is now; and this will enliven Trade at once all over <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſet all People to Work, which will make the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tien brisk and induſtrious, when they ſee that there is Riches 10 be got by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pains.</p>

But who can tell whether this Trade here ſpoke of will gain ſo Great a Summ as propoſed, or whether it will gain any thing at all; for there muſt be a great many employed about the Managing of it: So that the People employed may eat out all the Profits, and then how will the <hi>Bills</hi> be paid?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true that no man can tell what any Tradeſman or Trade will Gain, before it be ſet a going and tried; and yet this doth not diſcourage or hinder any Man from putting his Child or Children Prentice, or Setting them up when they come forth of their Prentiſhips: And we ſee very few that are Careful, and underſtand their Trade, and have a Stock to begin with, but what live well by it; And for them employed about this Trade eating out all the Profits: we ſee no Merchants or other great Traders, that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to employ ſo many <hi>Factors</hi> in forreign Countries, and <hi>Clerks,</hi> and <hi>Book-Keepers,</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> at home, as is neceſſary to Manage the Trade that each of them drive, without ever fearing the effects of this <hi>Objection;</hi> and yet we ſee many of them do grow vaſtly Rich by their Trade, notwithſtanding that they pay all neceſſary Servants: And why this <hi>Trade</hi> may not, cannot, or will not do the ſame, is unaccountable; For there is no particular Tradeſman in <hi>England,</hi> that will have the Tenth (or I believe the twentieth part of Stock to manage his Trade) with that this Trade will have; and then if the <hi>Maxim</hi> be true, <hi>That great Stocks do gain more in proportion than ſmall ones do,</hi> then this Trade will gain vaſtly more in proportion to the Stock, after all <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> are paid which will be needful to be employed about it; But if it ſhould gain nothing at all, as is objected, but only employ the <hi>Poor,</hi> ſo as to get their Living by their Work, yet the Nation will gain eight or nine Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions a Year by that, as is before-ſhew'd; and the <hi>Bills</hi> for twenty Millions for the Uſe of the <hi>Poor,</hi> will be paid by the <hi>Poor's Rates</hi> and <hi>Rents</hi> of <hi>Land</hi> bought in 17 Years and leſs; And if ten Millions be employed for the Uſe of the War, all the Bills will be paid by the <hi>Poors Rates</hi> and <hi>Rent</hi> of <hi>Land</hi> bought, in leſs than twenty five Years; So that if 10 profits ariſe by the Stock in Trade, yet the Gain to the Nation by it will be vaſtly Great, as is before Set-forth, by employing the People that now live in Idieneſs, and by working our own Manufactury, and in gaining the <hi>Poor's Rates,</hi> and <hi>Rents</hi> of <hi>Land</hi> bought, after the Bills are paid, and all the <hi>Work-Houſes,</hi> and Stock in them.</p>
